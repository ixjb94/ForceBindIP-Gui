## Download
[Force Bind IP](https://github.com/ixjb94/ForceBindIP-Gui/releases/download/binary/ForceBindIP.-.Gui.exe)

## Init
The init file for Quick Access consists of these options:    
1- Button=Button Name    
2- Address=.exe address    
3- X=86 or 64 (for setting it on default)    

Please note that Radio Button (x86 | x64) will override the X inside .init file.

## Automatic 
1. Run ForceBindIP-Gui.exe ( or compile .au3 it then open if u want )    
2. Click On "Download and Config"
3. Enjoy 

## Manuel
1. Download ForceBindIP ( https://r1ch.net/projects/forcebindip )    
2. Copy ForceBindIP To C:\Windows\system32 (for x86)    
3. Copy ForceBindIP To C:\Windows\sysWOW64 (for x64)    
4. Run ForceBindIP-Gui.exe ( or compile .au3 it then open if u want )      
5. Enjoy :)

## Google Chrome Compatibility
Chrome requires additional configuration to run under ForceBindIP. This is because Chrome 72 or later blocks 3rd party programs from injecting DLLs. To allow ForceBindIP to work, install this enterprise policy registry file to re-enable DLL injection, then open Chrome and go to chrome://flags/#network-service-in-process and enable the setting (Chrome 76+) or chrome://flags#network-service and disable the setting (Chrome 75-).    


## Firefox Compatibility
Firefox requires the about:config?filter=browser.launcherProcess.enabled preference set to false, otherwise ForceBindIP attaches to the launcher and not the actual program.

## Run Applications As x86 or x64
Some applications needs to run as x86 / x64    
So if you have a problem , try both of them ( ofc u need x64 windows to use x64 )

## Downloading ForceBindIP
If you can not download ForceBindIP by clicking on "Download and Config"     
Then Open "ForceBindIP-Download.exe" ( or compile .au3 it then open if u want )    

## Copying ForceBindIP
If you install ForceBindIP it might be in     
C:\Program Files (x86)\ForceBindIP    
or    
C:\Program Files\ForceBindIP
